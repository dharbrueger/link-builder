*Collocation* -
An arrangement or juxtaposition of words or other elements, especially those that commonly co-occur, as rancid butter, bosom buddy, or dead serious.

A small web based utility that serves as a proof of concept for creating 'links' of common collocations using an English language collocation API (https://rapidapi.com/petapro/api/linguatools-english-collocations).
